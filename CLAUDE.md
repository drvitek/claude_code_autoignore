## Code Style Guidelines
- This is a tool to configure Claude Code's ignorePatterns to mirror .gitignore files
- Follow consistent indentation (spaces preferred)
- Use descriptive variable/function names with camelCase
- Include type annotations when possible
- Keep functions small and single-purpose
- Separate concerns appropriately in code organization
- Use proper error handling with informative messages
- Follow import order: standard library → third-party → local
- Comment complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
- Handle edge cases explicitly
